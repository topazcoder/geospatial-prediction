# --- Gaia Miner Environment Variables Template ---
# This file serves as a template. Rename to .env (or your specific config name) 
# in your miner's configuration directory and fill in your actual values.

# --- Miner Database Configuration ---
# These settings are for the PostgreSQL database shared by tasks running on the miner,
# including the WeatherTask for its job tracking.

DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432

# --- General Miner & Bittensor Configuration ---
WALLET_NAME=gt0
HOTKEY_NAME=default
SUBTENSOR_NETWORK=test # Example: "finney" (for mainnet), "test" (for testnet), or "local" (for local)
NETUID=237 # NetUID for the subnet you are connecting to



# Logging level for the miner
# Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
MINER_LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO

# Environment type
# Options: "dev", "prod", "test"
ENV=prod
# change to test if you want to see more detailed logging

# Secret key for JWT if the miner uses its own API with authentication
MINER_JWT_SECRET_KEY=xxx # Please change this to a strong, random secret in your actual .env file. use `python ./gaia/miner/utils/generate_jwt_secret.py` to auto generate one and save to .env

# Minimum stake threshold for validators to interact with this miner (specific to some blacklist logic). Denoted in Alpha Tokens.
# testnet: 0
# finney: 10000 
MIN_STAKE_THRESHOLD=0

# --- Bittensor Axon Configuration (if miner is on Bittensor network) ---
# Public Port (this is the port that gets posted to the chain)
PUBLIC_PORT=33333
PORT=33334 # This is the port that the miner application listens on. Outside requests are forwarded to this port from nginx proxy.
EXTERNAL_IP="your_external_ip_address"  # Not needed for functionality, just nice for logging



# --- WeatherTask Configuration (for Miner) ---
# This section is particularly relevant if this miner is participating in the WeatherTask.

#Enable task
WEATHER_MINER_ENABLED=False #default is false, as task is "opt-in"

# Defines how the miner performs inference for the WeatherTask.
# Options:
#   "local"         - Runs the Aurora model directly within the WeatherTask process (requires local GPU/CPU resources & model files).
#   "http_service"  - Delegates inference to the containerized HTTP-based inference service (in gaia/miner/inference_service).
WEATHER_INFERENCE_TYPE=http_service 

# Directory where the miner caches GFS analysis data. This is used for:
#   1. Computing the input data hash sent to the validator.
#   2. Preparing the Aurora Batch if WEATHER_INFERENCE_TYPE="local".
#   3. Preparing the Aurora Batch before sending to the service if WEATHER_INFERENCE_TYPE="http_service".
# Ensure this path is writable by the miner process.
MINER_GFS_ANALYSIS_CACHE_DIR="./gfs_analysis_cache_miner" # Added variable

# Directory where the miner temporarily stores its final forecast outputs (e.g., Zarr files)
# after receiving results from local inference or the remote inference service.
MINER_FORECAST_DIR=/root/Gaia/miner_forecasts_background

# Controls how forecast files are served to validators for verification.
# Options:
#   "local"    - Downloads forecast files from R2 to local storage and serves them directly via HTTP/zarr (original design).
#                Requires more local storage but provides faster validator access.
#   "r2_proxy" - Acts as a proxy, streaming files from R2 on-demand without local storage.
#                Saves storage space but adds network latency for validator requests.
WEATHER_FILE_SERVING_MODE=local

# --- Configuration for WEATHER_INFERENCE_TYPE="local" ---
# (These are typically handled by the Aurora SDK defaults or internal WeatherTask logic if not set,
# but can be overridden. Refer to WeatherInferenceRunner in WeatherTask for details.)
# WEATHER_MODEL_REPO="microsoft/aurora" # HuggingFace repo or local path for the Aurora model
# WEATHER_MODEL_CHECKPOINT="aurora-0.25-pretrained.ckpt" # Checkpoint file name
# WEATHER_DEVICE="auto" # "cuda", "cpu", or "auto" for local inference

# --- Configuration for WEATHER_INFERENCE_TYPE="http_service" ---
# URL of the standalone weather inference service.

WEATHER_INFERENCE_SERVICE_URL="http://localhost:8000/run_inference"
# Example if inference service is Dockerized and miner is on host: "http://localhost:8000/run_inference"
# Example if both miner and service are Dockerized on same Docker network: "http://weather-inference-service:8000/run_inference"
# Example if the container is hosted on a Serverless/On-Demand endpoint : "http://runpod.
# (where 'weather-inference-service' is the Docker service name)

# ⚠️ CRITICAL: R2 Storage Configuration - Use these EXACT variable names ⚠️
# The code expects these specific variable names (NOT R2_BUCKET_NAME or R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID)
R2_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_BUCKET=<YOUR_R2_BUCKET_NAME>
R2_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

# API Key to authenticate the miner with the remote inference service.
# This key MUST match the API key configured on the inference service itself
# (e.g., via its INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY environment variable if the service implements API key auth).
# The code checks INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY first, then falls back to WEATHER_RUNPOD_API_KEY
INFERENCE_SERVICE_API_KEY="" # Primary API key variable (recommended)
# WEATHER_RUNPOD_API_KEY="" # Fallback API key variable (for compatibility)

# Additional generic credentials for accessing the inference service, if required by its hosting platform.
# These might be used for basic authentication or other custom authentication schemes.
# How these are used depends on the inference service's specific security setup.
CREDENTIAL_NAME=""  # e.g., a specific credential identifier for a cloud provider
USERNAME=""         # Username for basic auth or platform-specific auth
PASSWORD=""         # Password for basic auth or platform-specific auth

# --- Weather Task Remote Inference Service Configuration ---
# If you are using the provided HTTP inference service, these variables define the R2 storage
# it uses for model file downloads and data exchange.
# The inference service itself will read these from its environment.

# R2 Bucket for the Miner Inference Service (inputs/outputs)
# MINER_INF_SVC_R2_BUCKET_NAME=<YOUR_MINER_INF_SVC_R2_BUCKET_NAME>

# R2 Endpoint URL for the Miner Inference Service
# MINER_INF_SVC_R2_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com

# R2 Access Key ID for the Miner Inference Service
# MINER_INF_SVC_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YOUR_MINER_INF_SVC_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID>

# R2 Secret Access Key for the Miner Inference Service
# MINER_INF_SVC_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YOUR_MINER_INF_SVC_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

# API Key for the Miner Inference Service (if its runpodctl or API is secured)
# MINER_INF_SVC_API_KEY=<YOUR_MINER_INF_SVC_API_KEY>

# Log Level for the Miner Inference Service
# MINER_INF_SVC_LOG_LEVEL=INFO # (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

# Note: The WeatherTask's database manager for the miner will be configured to use PostgreSQL
# and these shared credentials and database name.
